# React + Vite

Project Name: React Website 1 (react-website1)

A practice responsive website built using ReactJS + Vite. Meant to develop my skills in React.

The website is a small travel website which features a navbar, main ad, additonal demo pages (3 - Products, Services, and Sign Up), and 5 cards containing travel destinations with short descriptions. Each of the cards links (same tab) to one of the demo pages.
